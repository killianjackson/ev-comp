# Electric vs Gas Vehicle Cost Comparision App

This application allows the user to select a gas vehicle and an electric vehicle and compare the 5 year cost of ownership based on the MSRP of the car, estimated yearly maintenance costs, and the cost of fuel for a 15,000 mile per year driver. I used this application as an opportunity to build a single page React app and focused on the features and UI before building an accurate, fully fleshed out dataset. Currently the app pulls dummy data from the firebase backend but I am working on filling the database with a full dataset.

A production build of the application is viewable at https://evcompare-89110.web.app/
